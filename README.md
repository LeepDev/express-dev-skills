# Express-Dev-Skills

## [X] Part 1

### [X] Exercises
The goal of the lab is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the Express - Routers & Controllers lesson:

- [X] Be sure to create an array of “fake” data representing some of your awesome developer skills. The specific properties describing a skill object is up to you!

- [X] Implement index functionality for the skills resource

- [X] Implement show functionality for the skills resource

### [X] Hints
- [X] Keep the data resource name short and simple - something like skills.

- [X] Following best-practice routing and MVC will result in the following modules for the skills resource:
    - routes/skills.js
    - models/skill.js
    - views/skills
    - controllers/skills.js
- [X] Use [RESTful routes](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6)

### [X] Bonuses
- [X] Use EJS partial views to make your templates more DRY (see link in Reference section of the lesson) and/or this link.

- [X] Add styling or use a CSS framework to make the app look better :)
